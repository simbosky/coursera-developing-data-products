## A first plotly plot
Using plotly to explore the traffic signals in Manchester data set. Firstly read the data.  

```{r}
traffic <- read.csv("TrafficSignals.csv")

```

A quick tidy.  

```{r}
traffic$Crossing_Facility <- gsub("P(ed|ED).*","PEDESTRIAN", traffic$Crossing_Facility)
traffic$Crossing_Facility <- gsub("P(uf|UF).*","PUFFIN", traffic$Crossing_Facility)
traffic$Crossing_Facility[traffic$Crossing_Facility==""] <- "NA"

```

And now plot!  

```{r}
qTraffic <- qplot(Type, data = traffic, colour=Crossing_Facility,fill=Crossing_Facility, xlab="Crossing Type", ylab="Number")+theme(axis.text.x = element_text(angle=90))+labs(fill="Facility", colour="Facility")
ggplotly(qTraffic)
```
